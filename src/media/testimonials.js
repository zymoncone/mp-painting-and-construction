          "the superb job in the remodeling / design of our bathroom, our entrance and upstairs hallways, and our " +
          "living room, all which included new sheetrock and painted walls, ceilings, the installation of wood floors, " +
          "and recessed lighting. We could not have asked for a more professional team than you and Marcos. \nYou are " +
          "to be commended for your attention to detail (even the handrails and light switches were given special " +
          "touches), your design ideas (the illusion shower door, the ceramic floor and ceiling tiles), the quality " +
          "of your new construction / renovation work, your 'hold-fast' timetable, and your fair and accurate cost " +
          "estimates. Each day we left our home in your safekeeping, and we returned each evening to breathtaking " +
          "renovation and a clean work site. Your sense of humor helped us through design choices, and it was a " +
          "pleasure to see you and Marcos each day. We thank you for a job well done and offer this letter of " +
